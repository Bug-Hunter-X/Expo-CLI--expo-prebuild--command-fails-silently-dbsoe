While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the `expo prebuild` command. The error message was vague, offering no specifics about the cause. The build process would halt abruptly, without providing any detailed information about which file or dependency was causing the problem.  This occurred consistently across different project versions and operating systems.  I tried clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and even creating a new project from scratch, but the issue persisted.
